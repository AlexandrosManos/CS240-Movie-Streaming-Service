Structures Movie Streaming Service

The project for the CS240 Data Structures course was a simplified movie streaming service. The service offers movies
classified into different categories. Users register to the service, watch movies by adding them to their history, accept
movie suggestions based on other users' watch history, and perform filtered searches across movie categories. For Phase A,
I used lists, linked lists, and stacks. On the other hand, I implemented Phase B using hash tables, binary search trees,
as well as leaf-oriented binary search trees.
